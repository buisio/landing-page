            </div>
            <div data-content>
              <p>Ops-as-a-Service will make sense for as it buys you
              more space and time to focus on your product.
              Designing and operating infrastructure in-house often
              don't improve the quality of your service and they
              definitely don't always result to an increase in your
              ability to ship solutions to your end-users.
              </p>
              <p>You probably hire an accountant such that you don't
              have to sweat over every detail, as long as the big
              picture makes sense. You probably hire plumbers to fix
              pipes even if you could probably do some of it yourself.
              Experts have a way of buying you time and peace of mind
              by doing something faster and qualitatively better than
              you could have possibly done it. All this while you are
              working on other things that are more valuable to your
              organization in the end.
              </p>
              <p>If you are a data-science shop, you could spend your
              budget on more brilliant data scientists and less on
              devops and tooling engineers, since a smaller team of
              devops engineers will be able to accommodate your
              needs with less stress. You will still be building your
              own tech, but at least your focus will be on your core
              product.
              </p>
              <p>As an IoT device manufacturer you can focus your
              resources on building the devices your customers want,
              need and deserve. Your resources can be directed towards
              better electrical engineering and industrial design
              talent as the use of stack1.io limits the scope of work and
              responsibilities for your devops teams without
              relinquishing them of ownership of your environment.
