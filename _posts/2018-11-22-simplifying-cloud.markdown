## Getting it right is hard

With all the developments we've seen in terms of automation which include
orchestration, containerization and virtualization, it is still surprising how
much time teams spend on reinventing the wheel regarding their basic plumbing.

Nearly every firm we've assisted in the last years, spent months on designing
pipelines, setting up orchestration tooling, figuring out workflows and
learning the ins and outs of their provider of choice. Initially, these points
may seem like a manageable amount of work, but experience will generally teach
that there is more than meets the eye.

## Mission

Our objective is to provide a decent solution for teams to to be able to focus
more on their product <em>rather than the support system</em> for their
product.

Teams should be able to provision decent working environments on their provider
of choice while maintaining full ownership of said environments and we are
building some tooling to make that happen.

If you're familiar with Heroku, we're trying to set up somthing as simple as
that. In the end we just want you to think about git pushes and see everything
materialize like magic :sparkles:.

## First lean steps :baby:

Our first step was to distil our learnings over the last couple of years down
to a few parameterized configurations that we can deploy and operate with a
collection of known and trusted tools such as Docker, Kubernetes and Terraform,
among others. Much of our previous work was directed at building setups on
Google Cloud and we've decided to keep our focus on this provider for the time
being as a considerable portion of our clients expressed a desire to use this
platform.

We have also done work on Alibaba Cloud, AWS, Azure and OpenStack-compliant
providers, but we're trying really hard to not get overexcited and try to build
configurations for all providers :grin: which is simply not a responsible
effort at this point. Discipline is hard :say_no_evil:.

We haven't <em>fully automated</em> any of this yet in an effort to remain
lean, as we're basically learning the needs of our existing customers and the
ones that join us on a continuing basis.

The fact is that even with some of the manual operations in our current
workflow, we have been able to provision viable environments for different
teams with considerably less effort than would be invested had those teams set
it all up by themselves.

If you need some help with infrastructure even if you're past the stage of
initial setup feel free to get in touch since we're eager to learn more about
the needs of different teams out there in the wild :wink:.

Hoping to learn from you.
